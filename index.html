          <p>Choosing which college to study at is a big life decision not only because the tuition itself is a big investment, but it also can have a lasting impact on our personal and professional life. This can be especially difficult for foreign students in the US because of the visa restriction and the language barrier. If your goal for college education is to find a job, then this article is for you. Many foreign students go after colleges with a high ranking, but there are other important factors that need to be considered when choosing colleges in the US. 
          </p>
 
 
    <h6>1. Major</h6>
 
    <p>If you have no idea which college to go to, you can choose your major first. Once you know what you want to study, then you can search for colleges that are known for that major. When choosing your major, you should consider your personal interest and the employment rate. Additionally, if you are an international student, then a STEM major can make a big difference. This is because STEM majors have three-year Optional Practical Training (OPT), which means foreign students can work in the US for three years while waiting for their H1B visa lottery, while non-STEM majors only have one-year. Also, it’s possible to change your major if you are accepted into a college, but make sure to do it early, as not every credit can be transferred to your new major.</p>
    
    <h6>2. Location</h6>
    <p>Location is very important because big cities often have more employment opportunities. As you may already know, many colleges in the US are located far away from big cities. If you do not know how to drive, you should also consider colleges located in the big cities as they have well-equipped public transportations. Studying in rural areas or big cities will also affect your overall college experience.
      </p>


<h6>3. Career Services</h6>

<p>Career services are important when choosing your college, as some colleges invest hugely in their career services, while other colleges may not. If a college focuses on helping their students get good jobs, this can be an invaluable resource for you. Things like helping students with their LinkedIn profile, resume, cover letter, mock interview, and career counseling are common services included in these programs. You can find their career services page on their school website, and it often comes with their employment report for their graduates each year. From there, you can find out where their students work after graduation.</p>


<h6>4. Tuition</h6>

<p>Tuition also needs to be considered when choosing colleges to study at, as the tuition in private schools is usually three times more than what it is in the public schools. Private schools tend to offer more scholarships for foreign students than public schools do. However, this does not necessarily mean that private universities are better options than public universities.</p>


<h6>5. School Reputation</h6>

<p>Nowadays, because of the internet, you can reach out to college graduates online and inquire about their schools. You can ask them what they like about and what they dislike about their colleges. This way, you can have a better idea about a college’s reputation from an inside view. Schools only advertise the good side, but students from those schools may have more unbiased opinions. You should also reach out to professionals in the field you want to work in and ask their opinions. This is especially important when you’re looking for a job after graduating, as some employers have their “target school” list, which means they prefer hiring students from that school.
</p>


<p>Choosing a college can be daunting, but hopefully these five considerations can make it a little bit easier. Regardless of which college you eventually choose, it will be a great experience. Not only will you get to experience what life in the US is like, but you’ll also learn a lot along the way.</p>
